# cleanNFHS5

dm: Either self-reported or high random glucose
htn: Either self-reported or high measured blood pressure

## Raw
toldhigh_dm/toldhigh_bp: Self-reported
medication_dm/medication_bp: Self-reported

## Processed
diagnosed_dm/diagnosed_bp: Self-reported
treated_dm/treated_bp: Self-reported

## For cleanNFHS5.Rmd
- Preserve the columns: c("hhid","linenumber","cluster","psu","state","district","strata","sampleweight")


# For CARRS_Predictions and NFHS5_FullData_W_Pred
- Keep column names consistent


# Columns to include as predictors
c_vars = c("waistcircumference", "hipcircumference", "weight", "height",
           "sbp", "dbp", "bmi", "age", 
           "eduyr")
p_vars = c("history_htn", # adjusted - NAs = 0 (categorical)
           "history_dm", # adjusted - NAs = 0 (categorical)
           "medication_bp", # adjusted - NAs = 0 (categorical)
           "medication_dm", "smokecurr",
           "alcohol",  "married", "kitchen",

glucose is tricky - since fasting glucose (fpg) is not equivalent to random glucose (glucose in NFHS-5)
